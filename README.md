# ngl-ts-demo
A simple demo of using NGL from a typescript project with NPM, in which 
the NGL type definitions can be used.

The result is a simple page with an embedded view of a protein.

## What to do?

```bash
# Clone it
git clone https://github.com/fredludlow/ngl-ts-demo

# Install
npm install 

# Build
npm run build

# Serve the files, e.g. with python
python -m http.server 8080
```

Click here: (http://localhost:8080/index.html) - or wherever else you're hosting it

## And that's it!

This is only a very minimal boilerplate example. Any questions, please open an issue!
